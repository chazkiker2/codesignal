1. What are the two primary categories for tree traversals?
    a. (1) Height-First, (2) Width-First
    b. (1) Depth-First, (2) Breadth-First
    c. Leaf-First, Branch-First
    d. Level-First, Branch-First
Answer: b. Depth-first, Breadth-first

2. select the three different types of depth-first traversals
    CORRECT preorder, postorder, inorder
    INCORRECT breadth-first, level-order, none of the above

3. select the correct ordering of steps for an inorder depth-first traversal
    a. left, visit, right
    -------------------------------
    1. go to the left of subtree
    2. visit node
    3. go to the right of subtree
    -------------------------------

    b. visit node, left right

    c. visit node, right, left

    d. right, left, visit

    e. left, right, visit


    d. right, visit, left


4. select the correct ordering of steps for a preorder depth-first traversal
visit, left, right

5. select ordering of steps for a postorder depth-first traversal
left, right, visit

6. what data structure would you use in order to write an iterative depth-first traversal method
stack, heap, queue, BST
stack
