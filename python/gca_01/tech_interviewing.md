Technical Interviewing
----------------------

Relax:

* Pretend that you already have the job, and the interviewer is coworker who
  is asking for help.

  * Puts you in a teaching mindset.

  * Makes you act like part of the team.

When you teach the problem:

* Use UPER

  * Understand: teach the problem back to the interviewer

    * Makes you think out loud
    * Gives you a chance to ask questions, clarifications
    * Gives the interviewer a chance to correct you
    * Your brain will start working on the plan

  * Plan: teach the plan to the interviewer

    * Most of the work is here.
    * Teach the interviewer how to solve the problem.
    * Can I solve a simplified version of the problem?
      * Can lead to a more full solution to the problem.
    * Can you come up with multiple approaches?
    * No code yet, pseudocode or English

  * Execute: code it up!

    * Translate the plan into code
      * If this is tough, maybe the plan's not complete or detailed enough.
    * If you don't exact syntax, ask, or make it up and say you'll look it up later.
    * Bugs
      * Could be an UP failure
      * Could be just dumb syntax bugs

  * Reflect

    * No one expects anyone to do this. So do it.
    * What would have made the solution better in any way?
    * What might be some future directions this? How could we use it?
    * If you didn't get it, say what you would do to keep attacking.


Additional pointers:

* Admit when you don't know something.
  * Doesn't mean giving up. If you don't know it, UPER it.
  * "I've never seen this problem before. Let's see what we can do with it."

* Enthusiasm for solving problems is gold.
  * Relentless tenacity is what makes great devs.
  * "The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried."

* If you can't think of a solution to the problem, at least bring up the closest
  thing you've done.

* Be sure you can answer "Why do you want to work here?"

* ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB
  * Research all you can about the company and position and product.
