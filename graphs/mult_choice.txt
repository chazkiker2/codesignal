Graphs and Trees Relationship

1. Which of the following statements is true:
a. Only some trees are graphs, but no graphs are trees
* b. All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees
c. All graphs are trees, but not all trees are graphs


Directed Vs Undirected Graphs
2. Choose the answer that best describes the difference between a directed and undirected graph
    a. Directed graphs best represent relationships that can be described as "mutual exchanges", while undirected
    graphs best represent relationships that can be described as "one way".

    b. Directed graphs can only be unidirectional but undirected graphs are always bidirectional

    c. Directed Graphs and undirected graphs are only different if they have edge weights that are associated with them

    * d. Directed graphs best represent relationships that can be described as "one way", while undirected graphs best
    represent relationships that can be described as "mutual exchanges".


Graph Adjacency List Representation
3. Choose the python code that correctly represents the graph shown in the picture using an adjacency list
    a   b   c   d   e   f
a   X   1   0   0   0   0
b   1   X   3   2   1   0
c   0   3   X   0   4   0
d   0   2   0   X   2   0
e   0   1   4   2   X   3
f   0   0   0   0   3   X

    a   b   c   d   e   f
a  [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
b   [1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0],
c   [0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0],
d   [0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0],
e   [0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 3],
f   [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]]

{
    "A": {"B": 1},
    "B": {"C: 3, "D": 2, "E": 1},
    C: {E: 4}


}



Graph Representation in Python Interpreter
3. Given the following `Vertex` and `Graph` classes, choose the Python Code (in interactive interpreter) that would
correctly create the graph pictured below
